  <p>Please remember: this is a model prediction. Seek clinical confirmation urgently.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1. Book an appointment with an endocrinologist or primary care physician immediately.</li>
    <li>2. Get confirmatory tests: fasting glucose, HbA1c, OGTT as recommended by your doctor.</li>

    <li>4. Start a medically supervised diet plan; consider carbohydrate counting.</li>
    <li>5. Discuss medications — metformin or others as per clinician guidance.</li>
    <li>6. Regular moderate exercise: 30 mins most days (walking, cycling, swimming).</li>
    <li>7. Manage blood pressure and cholesterol—get lipid profile and BP checked.</li>
    <li>8. Learn hypoglycemia signs and carry quick-sugar sources.</li>
    <li>9. Plan follow-up visits and keep a glucose log.</li>
    <li>10. Seek diabetes education programs for long-term self-management.</li>

  <ol>
    <li>Maintain a balanced diet: plenty of vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and legumes.</li>
    <li>Limit added sugars and refined carbohydrates (sodas, sweets, white bread).</li>

    <li>Keep a healthy BMI — combine portion control and regular exercise.</li>
    <li>Exercise ≥ 150 minutes/week moderate aerobic activity (walking, cycling).</li>
    <li>Prefer high-fiber foods and low-GI carbohydrates to control blood sugar.</li>
    <li>Stay hydrated and reduce sugary drinks; prefer water or unsweetened tea.</li>
    <li>Get regular health check-ups: fasting glucose and HbA1c yearly if risk factors exist.</li>
    <li>Avoid smoking and limit alcohol intake.</li>
    <li>Sleep 7–8 hours and manage stress (mindfulness, yoga, hobbies).</li>
  </ol>
